    "##### Project Description\n",
    "The aim of this project is to study the distribution and evolution of anophenile vectors of Malaria in Africa. \n",
    "The dataset is a compilation of all available mosquito studies from 1898 to 2016. It was compiled in *Kyalo D, Amratia P, Mundia CW et al. A geo-coded inventory of anophelines in the Afrotropical Region south of the Sahara: 1898-2016*, published in 2017 with the help of the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust, in collaboration with many major research agencies on Malaria. \n",
    "\n",
    "This data should help better understand how malaria developped in the past century and what species are primarily associated with its expansion. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to present this data in a clear fashion, showing trends in the evolution and the spread of anopheniles in Africa, and try to predict the future repartition of main malaria transmitting species. \n",
